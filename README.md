# musician-landing-page
Website design and development project undertaken to practice working with HTML and CSS. Second project undertaken as a novice developer.

This project sets out to create a landing page with external links and a call to action. The page contains an artist bio, several photos, some text relating to a music release, two external links to Spotify, links to two addtional webpages, and an external link to an Instagram profile. 

The call to action is to listen to an EP on Spotify. Did I mention that I'm the artist? 

This project serves two purposes;
  1. Practise and reinforce website development skills (HTML & CSS).
  2. Create a landing page that I can put to practical use for my music project.

  This project is solely maintained and contributed to by Alexander Brightman.
